<h1 align="center">Linear Algebra Refresher</h1>
This Repo features a refresher of Linear Algebra concepts from a few courses, starting with Udacity Linear-Algebra-Refresher Course.
In these lessons, we cover some of the most common Vector operations we'll encounter in in applications of Linear-Algebra in real life.

### Features:
Linear Algebra Concepts covered in this repo include:-

1. Vector addition and Subtraction
2. Vector Multiplication
3. Vector Normalization
4. Unit-Vector
5. Zero-Vector
6. Inner-Product or Dot-Product
7. Parallel Vectors
8. Orthogonal Vectors
9. Projecting Vectors on basis Vectors
10. Cross-Product
11. Calculating the Area of Parallelogram spanned by two Vectors
12. Calculating the Area of a Triangle spanned by two Vectors

Our goal is to become more familiar with the Arithmetic of Vectors and also to gain better intuition on Vector-Algebra.
